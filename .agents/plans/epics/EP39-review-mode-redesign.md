# EP39 - Review Mode Redesign (Memrise-style) in `srs-demo`

**Created**: 20260710T010141Z
**Status**: Accepted

<!-- Status: Draft | Accepted | In Progress | Impl-Complete | BDD Pending | Completed | Shelved | Withdrawn -->

**Type**: Epic Plan
**Depends on**: EP38 (Review mode: `GET /api/reviews`, `POST /api/reviews/answer`, `review_answer_events` log, `SqliteReviewStore`, `useReviewSession`, `QuizCard`, `ReviewSummary`, top nav), EP36 (`@gll/srs-review`: `FsrsScheduler.schedule`), EP30/EP34 (`@gll/db` async store)
**Parallel with**: N/A
**Predecessor**: N/A — extends EP38's review mode (does not replace it; the scheduled due-review loop is unchanged)

**Architecture**: [Review-Ahead (Eager Practice) and the Due-Gated Schedule-Advance Rule](../../../product-documentation/architecture/20260709T143643Z-engineering-review-ahead-and-due-gated-advance.md) — **Status: Accepted** (20260710). That ADR **amends** the [SRS Review Phase ADR](../../../product-documentation/architecture/20260321T145300Z-engineering-srs-engine-v2-review-phase.md) (reverses due-only) and the [Packaging & Rating ADR](../../../product-documentation/architecture/20260708T005635Z-engineering-srs-review-phase-packaging.md) (**resolves OQ8**). D5 (no self-rating prompt) and server-authoritative rating remain in force.

## Problem Statement

EP38 shipped Review mode, but three usability gaps blunt its effectiveness for the **eager learner**
— the user who wants to reinforce material daily rather than wait for the schedule:

1. **No feedback moment (G-001).** Answering an MCQ advances the queue immediately — the correct/wrong
   highlight never dwells and the correct answer is never revealed on a miss. Only the sentence path
   pauses to reveal. This undercuts active recall on every MCQ.
2. **No review-anytime (G-002).** Review honours due dates only; a learned-but-not-due word cannot be
   practised. When the due queue is empty the learner hits a dead-end "caught up" screen even though
   they want to keep going.
3. **No non-scheduling answer (G-003).** Every answer advances FSRS. Naively letting eager answers
   advance the schedule would let out-of-schedule cramming distort the very intervals FSRS exists to
   optimise.

**EP39 delivers the two must-have mechanisms** — an MCQ **feedback moment** and a **review-anytime
(eager) session** — plus the **review-tab hub** that surfaces them, all **layered on the existing
FSRS engine** (no scheduler replacement). The architectural core is one server rule: **advance the
schedule iff the card is due at answer time** (ADR §2), so eager/not-due answers are read-only to the
schedule while still being recorded. This closes the top-priority eager-learner gap without a
scheduler rewrite and without corrupting real intervals.

---

## Scope

**In scope**:

- **MCQ feedback moment (UI, `QuizCard`)** — after an MCQ answer, hold on a right/wrong state showing
  the chosen answer's correctness and revealing the correct answer on a miss, then advance on an
  explicit learner action ("Next"), mirroring the sentence path's existing two-step reveal. Applies to
  the review MCQ path. (FR-008/009/010, NFR-001.)
- **Due-gated schedule advance (server, `POST /api/reviews/answer`)** — the existing answer endpoint
  advances FSRS **iff the card is due at answer time**, derived **server-side** from the persisted
  `due` — never a client flag or session type. Not-due answers skip `FsrsScheduler.schedule` (schedule
  read-only) but are still appended to `review_answer_events`. One endpoint serves both due and eager
  answers. (FR-005/006/007/012, NFR-005, ADR §2/§3.)
- **Anytime (eager) session endpoint (server)** — a read route over **all learned words** via the
  existing (currently unused) `SqliteReviewStore.getAllReviewCards`, returning a **bounded batch of
  ≤50**, ordered **most-overdue-first** with a **least-recently-practised** re-rank on the not-due
  tail (recency derived from `review_answer_events`). Read-only. (FR-001/003/014/016.)
- **Review-tab mode hub (`srs-demo`)** — `navTo('review')` lands on a **mode-selection hub** listing
  **Due Review** and **Practice Anytime**, always reachable regardless of due-count. Replaces the
  current direct-into-due-session entry and the caught-up dead-end. (FR-002, resolves OI-003.)
- **Practice Anytime session (`srs-demo`)** — a session that pulls the anytime batch, resolves each
  `wordId` to content + distractors from the preloaded cross-deck `wordPool` (skip orphans), builds
  questions via the existing pipeline, presents them in the same UI as Learning/due-review with the
  new feedback moment, posts each answer to the due-gated endpoint, and shows an end-of-session
  summary. Exitable at any time, non-destructively. (FR-004/011/013/015.)

**Out of scope**:

- **Retry-until-correct-today** (original issue 2) with repeat-count affecting rating — strong future
  candidate; layers on FSRS as a session mechanic with no engine cost. Deferred.
- **Difficult Words** mode (isolate frequently-missed items) — nice-to-have, not committed. OQ-D
  (should a missed eager answer feed a future Difficult Words list, given it never advances the
  schedule?) travels with it.
- **Speed Review** (timed, hearts) and **typing / listening** test types.
- **Retention metric ("% of learned words retained")** — definition + instrumentation deferred and
  **non-blocking** (PO decision, 20260709). §3 keeps `review_answer_events` fed so no data is lost.
  (Gap G-004, OQ-C.)
- **Any FSRS replacement** — no fixed interval ladder / reset-to-4h. Memrise *feel* lives in the
  session/UI layers only.
- **Learning-path MCQ feedback** — `QuizCard` is shared; EP39 targets the review MCQ path. Whether
  Learning adopts the same dwell is a separate UI decision, not committed here.
- **Feedback auto-advance** — EP39 uses explicit "Next" (FR-010); timed auto-advance (OI-004) is not
  built.

## Stories

### Phase 1: Server — review-ahead read + due-gated advance (EP39-PH01)

### EP39-ST01: Anytime-reviews contract DTOs in `@gll/api-contract`

**Scope**: Add the anytime-session response DTO (learned cards as `{ wordId, due }`, server-ordered) and extend `ReviewAnswerResponse` to convey whether the answer advanced the schedule (e.g. `advanced: boolean` + the resulting `due`). Wire shapes only — no ordering/rating logic, no thresholds cross the contract.

### EP39-ST02: Due-gate the advance in `POST /api/reviews/answer`

**Scope**: Before scheduling, derive due-ness server-side from the persisted card's `due` at answer time. **Due** → run `FsrsScheduler.schedule` and persist (identical to today). **Not due** → skip scheduling, leave the card's scheduler state unchanged, and return `advanced:false` with the unchanged `due`. Both branches still append to `review_answer_events`. One endpoint, one code path, no client flag. (FR-005/006/007, NFR-005.)

### EP39-ST03: `GET /api/reviews/anytime` — all-learned-words batch

**Scope**: New read route backed by `SqliteReviewStore.getAllReviewCards(userId)`, returning a bounded **≤50** batch ordered **most-overdue-first**, with a **least-recently-practised** re-rank on the not-due tail (practice-recency read from `review_answer_events`). Read-only; orphan tolerance inherited from the store. (FR-001/003/014/016.)

### Phase 2: Client — MCQ feedback moment (EP39-PH02)

### EP39-ST04: MCQ feedback moment in `QuizCard`

**Scope**: On the review MCQ path, after an answer, enter a feedback state showing chosen-answer correctness and revealing the correct answer on a miss; advance on an explicit "Next". Mirror the sentence path's existing two-step reveal (correct/wrong + correct-answer + Next). No self-rating prompt (D5). Independent of Phase 1 — no server change. (FR-008/009/010, NFR-001/004.)

### Phase 3: Client — review-tab hub + Practice Anytime session (EP39-PH03)

### EP39-ST05: Review-tab mode-selection hub

**Scope**: `navTo('review')` lands on a hub listing **Due Review** (existing EP38 session) and **Practice Anytime**, reachable regardless of due-count (retains the unlock gate + due-count badge for the Due Review entry). Replaces the current direct due-session entry and the caught-up dead-end. State-`ref` SPA; no `vue-router`. (FR-002.)

### EP39-ST06: Practice Anytime session — presentation, answer, exit

**Scope**: New eager session in `useReviewSession` (or a sibling composable): fetch the anytime batch (ST03), resolve `wordId`→content/distractors from the preloaded `wordPool` (skip orphans), build questions via the existing pipeline, present in the shared `QuizCard` (with ST04 feedback), capture latency, POST each answer to the due-gated endpoint (ST02), and adopt `advanced`/`due` for the summary. Exitable at any time; already-answered words are persisted (write-on-answer), unanswered ones simply not served. Never imports `ts-fsrs`. (FR-004/011/015.)

### EP39-ST07: Anytime session summary

**Scope**: End-of-session summary for the anytime path (e.g. count reviewed; how many advanced vs. read-only), parity with the due-review summary, returning to the review hub. (FR-013.)

---

## Overall Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The review tab lands on a **mode hub** (Due Review · Practice Anytime), reachable even when
      nothing is due; the EP38 caught-up dead-end is gone.
- [ ] A learner can start a **Practice Anytime** session over learned words regardless of due date;
      the batch is **≤50**, most-overdue-first, with the not-due tail re-ranked least-recently-practised.
- [ ] Answering a **not-due** word in any path **does not** mutate its FSRS scheduler state
      (`due`/stability/difficulty) — the next scheduled review does not move — yet the answer **is**
      recorded to `review_answer_events`. (NFR-005 / ADR §3.)
- [ ] Answering a **due** word advances its schedule exactly as EP38 does, whether reached via the due
      queue or an anytime session; due-ness is derived **server-side**, not from a client flag.
- [ ] After an **MCQ** answer the learner sees whether they were correct and, on a miss, the correct
      answer, and advances only on an explicit action. No self-rating prompt appears (D5).
- [ ] A learner can **exit** a review session at any time non-destructively; re-entering a Practice
      Anytime session does **not** re-serve the same **not-due** words in the same order (due words
      self-demote via their advanced schedule).
- [ ] **Edge/limit**: a learned word that cannot be resolved to content/distractors (orphan) is
      skipped without failing the anytime session (pillar-3 tolerance holds through the UI).
- [ ] **Edge/limit**: a failed `review_answer_events` append on the not-due path is fail-open — it
      must not fabricate a schedule advance, and a failed *schedule* write on the due path leaves the
      card unchanged and surfaces a typed error (write-on-answer contract, unchanged from EP38).
- [ ] Frontend bundle does not import `ts-fsrs` (grep guard passes).

   feedback moment + review hub + Practice Anytime session)
4. Begin implementation — build order: ST02 due-gate → ST03 anytime endpoint → ST04 feedback (parallel,
   no server dep) → ST05/06/07 hub + session
5. **Deferred by scope** (unchanged from Out of scope): retry-until-correct-today, Difficult Words
   (+ OQ-D), Speed Review, typing/listening types, retention metric (OQ-C), feedback auto-advance
   (OI-004), Learning-path MCQ feedback
