# Terminal Quiz Runner

Run with `pnpm quiz` (or `tsx scripts/quiz-runner.ts`).

An interactive terminal quiz that exercises the SRS engine end-to-end with real Thai language seed data. This is an **engine validation tool** — it proves the `SrsEngine` API works correctly, not a user-facing product.

---

## How it works

1. Loads seed data: **5 foundational Thai consonants** (ก ข ค ง จ) + **vocabulary from conversation decks** (~49 curated words after dedup).
2. Loops: compose a batch → present questions → accept self-assessed answers (`c`orrect / `w`rong / `q`uit) → update mastery → print summary → repeat.
3. All data is in-memory. Nothing is persisted between runs.

## Current config

| Setting | Value | What it controls |
|---------|-------|------------------|
| `batchSize` | 15 | Max questions per batch (actual count depends on eligible words) |
| `masteryThreshold.foundational` | **5** | Correct answers to promote a foundational word to `srsM2_review` |
| `masteryThreshold.curated` | **10** | Correct answers to promote a curated word to `srsM2_review` |
| `activeWordLimit` | 20 | Max words in the active learning window |
| `newWordsPerBatch` | 3 | New words introduced per batch |
| `lapseThreshold` | 3 | Wrong answers in `srsM2_review` before resetting to `learning` |
| `shelveAfterBatches` | 5 | Batches without progress before a word is shelved |
| `maxShelved` | 50 | Max simultaneously shelved words |
| `continuousWrongThreshold` | 3 | Consecutive wrongs on a foundational word to reset mastery to 0 |
| `questionTypeSplit` | 60% mc / 30% wordBlock / 10% audio | Question type distribution |
| `foundationalAllocation` | 20% active / 5% post-depletion | Batch slots reserved for foundational words |

## Behaviors you will observe (not bugs)

### Small initial batches
The first batch has only **3 questions**, not 15. This is because `newWordsPerBatch=3` limits how many new words enter the active window per batch. Batches grow as words get promoted to `srsM2_review` (they become "active" and carry over).

### Promoted words keep appearing
Once a word reaches `srsM2_review`, it **does not exit the deck**. It becomes a carry-over word and appears in every subsequent batch. In a real app with persistence, FSRS would space reviews out (1 day → 3 days → 14 days…). In this in-memory runner there is no time passage, so FSRS intervals don't apply and the word keeps showing up.

### Mastery count keeps rising past the threshold
A foundational word promoted at `masteryCount=5` will show `mastery=6, 7, 8…` in later batches. This is correct — the threshold only gates the phase transition. Mastery continues to be tracked in `srsM2_review`.

### Same words repeat across batches
Words in `learning` phase reappear until promoted. Words in `srsM2_review` reappear as carry-over. New words (3 per batch) are introduced only when there's room in the active window.

### Foundational words appear before curated words
The engine prioritises: carry-over → foundational revision → new words → foundational learning. Foundational consonants (with a lower threshold of 5) promote faster and dominate early batches.

### 3 consecutive wrongs resets foundational mastery
If you answer a foundational word wrong 3 times in a row during `learning` phase, its `masteryCount` resets to 0. This is the `continuousWrongThreshold` rule.

## Question types

| Type | Foundational example | Curated example |
|------|---------------------|-----------------|
| **mc** (multiple choice) | What is "ก"? → Ko Kai — k | What does "หิว" mean? → hungry |
| **wordBlock** | Spell the romanization of "จ" → ch | Arrange: "hungry" in Thai → หิว |
| **audio** | Listen: "ก" — what sound? → k | Listen: "หิว" — meaning? → hungry |

Audio questions appear in the distribution breakdown but are not actually playable in the terminal.
